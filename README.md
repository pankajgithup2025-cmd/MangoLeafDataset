The dataset comprises six classes of Mango Leaf Disease, namely Anthracnose, Dieback, Insect Damage Webber, Gall Midge Damage, Leaf Blight, and Healthy, with a total of 6640 samples. 
This dataset can be utilized not only for disease classification but also for a wide range of computer vision research tasks. 
It provides a strong foundation for training and evaluating deep learning architectures, performing transfer learning experiments, and benchmarking novel lightweight models suitable for real-time agricultural 
applications.
| Class Name           | Samples     |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Anthracnose          | 886         |
| Dieback              | 1084        |
| Insect Damage Webber | 1136        |
| Gall Midge Damage    | 635         |
| Leaf Blight          | 949         |
| Healthy              | 1950        |
| **Total**            | 6640        | 

Beyond classification, the dataset can be employed for data augmentation using advanced generative techniques. 
Models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models can be applied to generate synthetic yet realistic mango leaf images, thereby expanding the dataset, addressing class imbalance, 
and improving model generalization. Such augmentation strategies are particularly valuable when collecting additional real-world data is costly or time-consuming. Additionally, 
the dataset can support explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM for visualizing disease-specific regions, feature engineering studies for traditional classifiers, 
and the development of precision agriculture solutions aimed at early detection and disease management.
